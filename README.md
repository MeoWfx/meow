Hi there!!,

I hope this message finds you well! I’m thrilled to share my first project,  Stockify! 🚀, an Inventory Management System I developed to simplify product management for businesses.

Stockify is a console-based C++ application that enables administrators and users to:
    Manage products and categories.
    Monitor stock levels and receive low-stock warnings.
    Process purchases and generate detailed user reports.
    Import/export data seamlessly via CSV files.
I designed Stockify to tackle common inventory challenges, making it ideal for small businesses looking for an efficient way to manage their stock.

Key Features:
    📦 Product Management: Add, update, and delete products or categories.
    👥 User Management: Secure login for admins and users, with feedback functionality.
    📊 Data Persistence: Uses CSV files for saving and retrieving product and user data.
    
I’d love to hear your feedback or thoughts on how I can enhance Stockify further. If you'd like to explore its functionality or see a live demo, feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to walk you through it!

Looking forward to your input and guidance. Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!

Best regards,
Muhammad Ahmad aka Meowfx🐱
